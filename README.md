Lyo is the easiest way to publish Node.js modules as browser-compatible libraries.

No decision-making, no configuration needed, it just works!

Lyo uses Browserify, Babel, UglifyJS, and a pinch of magic âœ¨ so you don't have to worry about configuring them.

## Install & Run

```sh
# Install globally
npm i -g lyo

# Run
lyo
```

## Options

Lyo is supposed to work right away, but you can force things with some options if needed.

```
$ lyo --help

    Usage
      $ lyo [options]        Run Lyo
      $ lyo init [options]   Add Lyo to your project
      $ lyo usage [options]  Show how to use the output file 

    Options
      --input   -i  Entry file
      --output  -o  Output file / folder
      --name    -n  Module name in browser
      --banner  -b  Add a banner to the top of the bundle

    Examples
      $ lyo
      $ lyo -i main.js
      $ lyo -n runFunction
      $ lyo -o dist/bundle.min.js
      $ lyo -b 'Lyo\nLicensed under MIT'
```


## Recommended workflow

Once you've tried Lyo on your module and figured the good options to use, you should consider the following steps

### 1. Add Lyo to your project

Run `lyo init` (with options) to edit your `package.json` as follows:

- Lyo will be added to the dev dependencies
- A pre-publish script will be created (or edited) so Lyo is triggered before every `npm publish`
- If you provide options, **they will be saved as default options**

```
# Example with some random options
$ lyo init -i lib/main.js -n runMyModule
```

Don't forget to run `npm install` after that

### 2. Add documentation

Run `lyo usage` (with options) to show an example code snippet. You can edit and include it in your `README.md`.

```
$ lyo usage

> Edit and include the following snippet in your README.md
```

### 3. Commit and publish

Lyo will output a single file called a _bundle_, by default in a `dist` folder. You can choose to commit it, or not.
It's really up to you.

Run `npm publish`, Lyo will compile your module, and the bundle will be pushed to the npm registry with the rest of your module.
Congratulations, you're done! ðŸ’ª

### Additional tips

- Don't use the bundle in a Node.js environment. The bundle is supposed to run in browsers only
- Don't immediately blame Lyo if it fails to compile your code. The error could come from Browserify, Babel or UglifyJS


## FAQ

#### What if I need unsupported features?

If you need unsupported features (sourcemaps, code splitting...), just don't use Lyo. Lyo is nothing more than an
all-in-one package, with automatic configuration.

Feel free to use gulp, grunt, or any other tool that could meet your needs

#### Why developing Lyo when there are thousands of better tools?

Lyo's philosophy is highly inspired from [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo), a linter that works immediately, without any
configuration. XO is just an ESLint wrapper, but it saves you the hassle of choosing ESLint rules, adding them to a
new `.eslintrc` file, installing plugins...

I use XO for almost all my projects, but I could not find any tool as simple as XO for Node.js > browser compilation, so
I created Lyo for that purpose
 
#### What does Lyo mean?

Lyo is short for [lyophilization](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lyophilization), a process that transforms food
into a dry and compact form
